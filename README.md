## Description

- This project is a simple application for a fictional sushi restaurant. 
- I created an internal API to handle the current list of menu items. Hopefully full CRUD actions can be added at a later point. 
- I chose to create an internal server, without any 3rd party dependencies, to practice and gain some insight into creating simple servers from scratch. 

## Prequisites

- Node.js
- NPM

An internet browser, and a desktop PC or Mac

## Usage

- Visit the website
- Click on each leaders image to gain an insight into the leader types

## Deployment

- Run Npm install from the command line
- Run Npm start
- Visit localhost/5000
- Enjoy!
